# Development Best Practices for BBC News Headline Analyzer

To ensure the BBC News Headline Analyzer remains maintainable, scalable, and efficient as it evolves, adopting a set of development best practices is crucial. These practices cover how to structure branches, commit changes, manage pull requests (PRs), and structure the project for future expansion, such as transitioning from a script to a RESTful API.

## Branching Strategy

Trunk-based development (TBD) centers around a single branch (often called main or master) where all development activity happens. Feature branches are used minimally, if at all, and are kept short-lived to encourage rapid integration of changes.

### Key Practices in Trunk-Based Development

Main Branch

* Single Source of Truth: The main branch acts as the single source of truth for the project's current state. All development work is integrated into this branch frequently.
* Continuous Integration: Changes are integrated and tested often, ideally multiple times a day, to ensure that the main branch is always in a deployable state.

Short-Lived Feature Branches

* Duration: If feature branches are used, they should exist for no more than a few days before being merged back into main. This minimizes merge conflicts and integration challenges.
* Branch Naming: When necessary, use descriptive names for feature branches, e.g., `fix/login-bug` or `feature/add-analytics`.

Feature Flags

* Toggle Functionality: Introduce feature flags to manage the visibility and activation of new features. This allows incomplete or experimental features to be merged into main without affecting the production environment.

### Feature Branches

- **Naming Convention**: Use a consistent naming pattern for feature branches, such as `feature/feature-name` or `feature/feature-description`.
- **Purpose**: Each feature branch should be dedicated to the development of a specific feature or improvement. This isolation makes code reviews and testing more manageable.
- **Example**: For a feature adding new analytics capabilities, name the branch `feature/analytics-enhancements`.

### Transitioning to API

- **Branch `feature/from-script-to-api`**: This branch should demonstrate the initial steps in transitioning the project from a script to a RESTful API. It might include foundational code, an `infra` directory pre-configured with necessary infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, and documentation on the intended architecture.
- **Iterative Development**: Gradually build out the API, ensuring that each commit represents a stable and incremental improvement over the script version.

## Commit Guidelines

- **Atomic Commits**: Make small, atomic commits that represent a single logical change. This practice facilitates easier code reviews and debugging.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the "why" behind the change. Begin with a short summary (50 characters or less), optionally followed by a detailed description if necessary.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Description**: Each PR should include a comprehensive description of the changes, including the purpose of the feature or bug fix and any relevant details.
- **Review Process**: PRs should be reviewed by at least one other developer to ensure code quality, adherence to project standards, and compatibility with the existing codebase.
- **Testing**: Include details of any tests run, including automated unit tests and manual testing procedures, to verify the functionality.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This ensures that the `main` branch is always deployable and that any new changes are verified before integration.

## Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic, assumptions, or important decisions.
- **README Updates**: Keep the README document updated with any significant changes, including new features, configuration steps, or architectural modifications.

## Example for API Transition

For the transition to an API, consider the following initial steps outlined in the `feature/from-script-to-api` branch:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: In the `infra` folder, include configuration files for containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes or Docker Compose) to support scalable deployment.
2. **API Framework**: Start with a simple Flask or FastAPI application structure. Define routes corresponding to existing script functionalities (e.g., fetching headlines, summarizing content).
3. **Refactor Code**: Modularize the script into components that can be easily called by the API endpoints, ensuring that each functionality (scraping, summarizing, sentiment analysis) is accessible via the API.
